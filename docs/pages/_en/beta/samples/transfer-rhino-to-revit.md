title: Transfer Rhino to Revit
order: 1

{% include ltr/en/wip_note.html %}

This sample shows how to take normal Rhino breps, curves and points into Revit.

There are a lot of ways to bring in the Rhino geometry, but in this case we will be bringing them in as DirectShape elements.

## Bringing Breps into a Revit category
Rhino surfaces and brep solids can be imported into Revit as a categorized DirectShape.

Open Sample files:
1. Open the [Rhino to Revit.rvt]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/samples/transfer-rhino-to-revit/rhino_to_revit.rvt) in Revit.
1. Start Rhino.Inside.Revit and open the [Rhino office.3dm]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/samples/transfer-rhino-to-revit/rhino_office.3dm) file.
1. Start Grasshopper within Rhino.

The component necessary:
1. DirectShape Category picker
1. Directshape from Geometry
1. Brep Param component in Grasshopper

![Rhino Brep to Revit as Directshape]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/images/rhino-to-revit-brep.jpg)
Once you select the Breps, those will feed into the Direct component.

## Live-linking Points
Rhino curves can be linked/embedded into Revit and Grasshopper will keep them up to date.

The component necessary:
1. Curve from Geometry
1. Curve Param component in Grasshopper

![Rhino Curve to Revit]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/images/rhino-to-revit-points.jpg)
Once you select the curves, those will feed into Revit.

## Bringing in complex curves
Rhino points can be linked/embedded into Revit and Grasshopper will keep them up to date.

The component necessary:
1. Curve from Geometry
1. Curve Param component in Grasshopper

![Rhino curve to Revit]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/images/rhino-to-revit-curves.jpg)
Once you select the points, those will feed into Revit.
